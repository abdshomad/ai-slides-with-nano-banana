# 1. Introduction & Vision

### 1.1. Overview
The AI Presentation Designer is a revolutionary web application that transforms a single prompt into a complete, polished, and ready-to-use presentation. It streamlines the initial creation process by leveraging the advanced capabilities of the Google Gemini API to handle research, content strategy, and initial design.

A key innovation is its sequential generation process, which creates a cohesive visual narrative by evolving imagery from one slide to the next.

Beyond initial creation, the application provides a comprehensive suite of AI-powered editing tools. Users can refine, adapt, and enhance every aspect of their presentation—from rewriting content for different audiences and fact-checking data to generating new visuals in a dedicated "Visuals Studio"—making it a powerful partner for both rapid creation and detailed refinement.

### 1.2. Problem Statement
Creating effective presentations is a common but often tedious task for professionals, students, and educators. The process involves structuring a narrative, writing concise content, designing slides, and finding relevant visuals. This can take hours of manual effort and often requires design expertise that many users lack.

### 1.3. Vision
To be the most powerful and intuitive AI-native tool for presentation creation. Our vision is to empower users by eliminating the complexities of initial drafting while providing a robust suite of intelligent tools for refinement and customization, allowing them to achieve a professional-quality finished product with maximum efficiency.

# 2. Goals & Objectives

*   **Achieve a "One-Click" Generation Experience:** Minimize user configuration and decision-making to the greatest extent possible. The primary interaction should be providing a topic and receiving a finished presentation.
*   **Maximize Automation:** The AI should autonomously handle all aspects of creation, including research, content strategy, tone selection, visual design, and layout choices.
*   **Deliver Superior Quality by Default:** Ensure all generated presentations are well-structured, factually sound, and visually appealing without requiring any manual adjustments from the user.
*   **Build User Trust in AI:** Create a seamless and reliable experience that instills confidence in the AI's ability to act as an expert presentation designer.
*   **Drastically Reduce Creation Time:** Decrease the end-to-end time from idea to downloadable presentation to just a few minutes.

# 3. User Personas

### 3.1. Alex, the Marketing Manager
*   **Needs:** Quickly create compelling, data-informed presentations for client pitches and internal reporting. Needs to incorporate information from reports and web research.
*   **Pain Points:** Spends too much time formatting slides and finding high-quality, relevant images. Struggles to keep presentations concise and impactful.
*   **How We Help:** Alex can upload marketing reports and provide a simple prompt. The AI generates a well-structured outline with sources, creates a full slide deck with a professional tone, and suggests relevant images, freeing Alex to focus on strategy. The integrated fact-checking tool gives him confidence that the data points in his pitches are accurate.

### 3.2. Sam, the University Student
*   **Needs:** Create clear, well-organized presentations for class projects and assignments, often on short deadlines.
*   **Pain Points:** Not a design expert. Finds it difficult to structure research notes into a coherent presentation flow.
*   **How We Help:** Sam can paste lecture notes and research paper excerpts into the app. The AI helps structure the content into a logical outline and generates slides, allowing Sam to produce a high-quality presentation quickly. The fact-checking feature helps him verify his claims and submit assignments with greater academic integrity.

### 3.3. Dr. Chen, the University Professor
*   **Needs:** Develop engaging lecture materials for various courses. Needs to be able to quickly adapt content for different audiences and update it with the latest research.
*   **Pain Points:** Time-poor due to teaching, research, and administrative duties. Reusing old slide decks is inefficient and leads to stale content.
*   **How We Help:** Dr. Chen can provide a topic or a research paper. The AI generates a foundational lecture outline and slides, complete with speaker notes and key takeaways. This base can be quickly refined and expanded upon, saving hours of prep time for each lecture. The fact-checking capability allows her to quickly verify that her lecture content reflects the most current research before presenting to students.

# 5. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **NF-01 (Performance & Responsiveness):** The UI must remain responsive and interactive at all times. Long-running AI processes are handled as follows:
    *   **Blocking Global Actions:** The initial outline generation is a blocking operation that affects the entire project. It displays a full-screen progress view, as the user must wait for completion before proceeding.
    *   **Incremental Global Actions:** The sequential slide generation is a long-running global process that provides incremental results. The UI remains interactive, allowing the user to view and navigate through completed slides while subsequent ones are being generated. Progress is clearly indicated by a loading state on the current slide being generated and a countdown timer for the next.
    *   **Non-Blocking Local Actions:** Asynchronous tasks on individual slides (e.g., generating speaker notes, fact-checking, expanding content, generating an image) must not block the main UI. The user can continue to work on other slides while these tasks run in the background. Progress is indicated on the specific UI element that triggered the action.
*   **NF-02 (Usability):** The application follows an intuitive, step-by-step workflow. Interactions are straightforward, discoverable, and require a minimal learning curve.
*   **NF-03 (Accessibility):** The application adheres to WCAG 2.1 AA standards, including proper use of ARIA attributes for screen readers, full keyboard navigation, and sufficient color contrast ratios.
*   **NF-04 (Browser Compatibility):** Must function correctly on the latest stable versions of major desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
*   **NF-05 (Security):** The user's Gemini API key is treated as a sensitive environment variable and is not exposed on the client-side or stored in Local Storage.
*   **NF-06 (State Management & Persistence):** Application state is managed predictably. All user-generated content and project history is reliably persisted in the browser's Local Storage, featuring an auto-save mechanism to prevent data loss. To further prevent data loss, users will be prompted for confirmation before navigating away from the page while a presentation is actively being generated.
*   **NF-07 (Maintainability):** The codebase is modular and well-structured, utilizing a clear separation of concerns (e.g., components, hooks, services, utils) to ensure long-term maintainability and scalability.
