# 4.3. Step 2: Outline Generation & Refinement

After providing initial context, the user enters an interactive outline generation and refinement stage.

*   **F-OG-01 (AI Outline Generation):** The AI generates a comprehensive and logically structured presentation outline.
    *   **F-OG-01a (Web Research):** The AI uses Google Search to gather up-to-date information, ensuring content is relevant and accurate.
    *   **F-OG-01b (Source Citing):** The URLs of web sources used by the AI are extracted and displayed to the user for verification.
    *   **F-OG-01c (Automated Selections):** The AI autonomously suggests a presentation title, content tone (e.g., Professional, Casual), and a visual design template based on its analysis of the topic.
    *   **F-OG-01d (Intelligent Layout Strategy):** The AI assigns the most effective layout for each planned slide to best represent the information (e.g., using "Timeline" for chronological data or "Comparison" for contrasting ideas).
*   **F-OG-02 (Generation Progress):** While the outline is being generated, a detailed progress screen informs the user of the AI's current phase (e.g., Deconstruction, Information Gathering, Narrative Design, Blueprint Generation) and sub-steps.
*   **F-OG-03 (Interactive Outline Editor):** The user is presented with a two-pane view for refining the generated outline before creating slides.
    *   **F-OG-03a (Text Editor):** A text editor displays the raw, editable outline, allowing users to directly modify slide titles and bullet points.
    *   **F-OG-03b (Live Preview):** A live preview pane visually represents the structured outline, showing each slide with its title, content points, and assigned layout.
    *   **F-OG-03c (Diagram View):** Users can switch the preview pane to a "Diagram View," which displays the presentation flow as a Mermaid.js flowchart, offering a high-level structural overview.
*   **F-OG-04 (Outline Manipulation):** Users can interact with the live preview to modify the structure.
    *   **F-OG-04a (Add/Remove Slides):** Add new blank slides or remove existing slides from the outline.
    *   **F-OG-04b (Regenerate Slide Content):** Select any slide and provide a natural language prompt to the AI to regenerate its title and bullet points (e.g., "make this more concise").
    *   **F-OG-04c (Change Layout):** Change the AI-suggested layout for any slide by selecting from a list of available options (e.g., Hero, Default, Two Column Text).
*   **F-OG-05 (Pre-Generation Customization):** Before proceeding, users can override the AI's initial suggestions.
    *   **F-OG-05a (Tone Selection):** Choose a different content tone (e.g., Enthusiastic, Concise).
    *   **F-OG-05b (Template Selection):** Select a different visual design template.
    *   **F-OG-05c (Slide Count Adjustment):** Use a slider to adjust the final number of slides to be generated.
